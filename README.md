Biotite, bornite and chrysocolla clasification with a Convolutional Neural Network

This academic proyect consists in creating and training a convolutional neural network using tensorflow keras capable of clasifing images of biotite, bornite and chrysocolla. Such as fine tunning an existent convolutional neural network and comparing their perfonmance. Data augmentation is used to enhance the dataset.
