Biotite, bornite and chrysocolla clasification with a Convolutional Neural Network

This academic proyect consists in creating and training a convolutional neural network using tensorflow keras capable of clasifing images of biotite, bornite and chrysocolla. Such as fine tunning an existent convolutional neural network and comparing their perfonmance. The main objective of this proyect is to demonstrate how to work with a small, unbalanced dataset and still get good results in terms of accuracy. Data augmentation and several techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout are utilized in the training steps.
