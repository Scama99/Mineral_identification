Biotite, bornite and chrysocolla classification with a Convolutional Neural Network

This academic project consists in creating and training a convolutional neural network using tensorflow keras capable of classifying images of biotite, bornite and chrysocolla. Such as fine tuning an existent convolutional neural network and comparing their performance. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to work with a small, unbalanced dataset and still get good results in terms of accuracy. Data augmentation and several techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout are utilized in the training steps.
